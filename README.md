# go-reconcile

Super tiny go package which does reconcile planning: taking desired list and current list and returning the action to take to reach desired states (adding to or deleting from current state). I wrote this package to play with Go1.18 generics functinality and you should not use this in your code if possible. I recommend you to write your own if you need similar functionality in your code.

*NOTE*: To run this code, you need to use Go1.18 or later
